Search Engine: Bing

Average percent overlap: 28.40%
Average Spearman coefficient: -8.20

The Bing search engine performed worse than Google based on the rankings.
The low overlap percentage indicates that the results returned by Bing differed significantly from Google's top results. 
Additionally, the negative Spearman coefficient suggests that the ranking order of the results was not only different but inversely correlated with 
Google's rankings. These two metrics combined demonstrate that the search engine struggled to match Google's consistency in delivering results.
